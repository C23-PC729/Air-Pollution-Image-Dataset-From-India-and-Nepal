Introduction:
The Air Pollution Image Dataset from India and Nepal is a collection of images that depicts the level of air pollution in various cities of India and Nepal. 
The dataset has been created to help researchers and data scientists to study the effects of air pollution on human health and the environment. 
The images in the dataset have been captured using cameras installed at various locations in the cities.

Dataset Description:
The Air Pollution Image Dataset from India and Nepal consists of a total of 12,240 images. 
Each image is of size 224 x 224 pixels and is saved in the JPG format. The dataset has been divided into two parts, 
one for India and the other for Nepal. 
The images in the dataset have been labeled according to the city they have been captured in. 
The dataset contains images from the following cities:

India:
